# pytorch-audio-ddp-bird-classification
This project develops a deep learning model in PyTorch to classify bird species from a large audio dataset (~26 GB of bird songs). It uses Librosa for audio processing and applies data augmentation. PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) optimizes multi-GPU training for faster and efficient model training.
